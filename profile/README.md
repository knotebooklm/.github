# KnotebookLM
Curious about AI, preferring to learn by building, and bowled over by Google's new ~homework machine~ research tool, the [northridge devs](https://github.com/northridge-dev) set out to recreate [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com).

They codenamed their project **KnotebookLM**. 

And you've found it.
